What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	First the .git file is being created. There informations about changies will be storied.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	You can choose which files you want to include in next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Using git add I can choose which file to move to staging area and choose that with logic.
