When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositories are useful for sharing your work with other people, between computers and colaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I might to want to public changies when I'm not ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	When I work on my own project I use branches, I clone repositories if I use different computer and forking to contribute to someone else project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If know the common ancestor, when I make changies and someone else as well I know when we had a staarting point for those changies.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without git and github I would have to send my files through emails and waiting for respond. It will be much harder than with git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	
	To check new idea, version. It allows to do it without interupting main work
