When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositories are useful for sharing your work with other people, between computers and colaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I might to want to public changies when I'm not ready.
